# -ESP32-Custom-PCB-Design-OrCAD-
This repository documents the design and development of a custom ESP32-WROOM-32 PCB, created using OrCAD Capture and PCB Editor. The design includes integration of external SRAM and Flash memory for enhanced performance and memory capacity — ideal for IoT, real-time processing, and embedded applications.
Excited to share my recent project — a fully custom ESP32-WROOM-32 PCB designed from the ground up in OrCAD Capture and PCB Editor!

💡 From idea to fabrication-ready design, here’s what I tackled:
✅ Complete schematic design based on ESP32 reference architecture
✅ Integrated key components: voltage regulator, USB-to-serial (CP2102), reset & boot circuitry, and GPIO access headers
✅ Created and assigned custom footprints to match real-world dimensions
✅ Optimized trace routing with proper power/ground planes and antenna clearance
✅ Passed all ERC/DRC checks and generated clean, fabrication-ready Gerber files

🛠️ This project sharpened my skills in PCB layout, embedded hardware design, and advanced use of OrCAD tools — bringing me one step closer to building powerful IoT solutions.

👀 Looking forward to prototyping and testing this board soon!
